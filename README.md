# Sitong Chen

I am a Biomedical Engineering student at Southern University of Science and Technology, passionate about advancing **Brain-Computer Interface(BCI**) **technologies** to restore autonomy for individuals with neurological disorders. My current work focuses on multimodal neural decoding, EEG signal analysis, and democratizing neurotechnology for real-world impact. During my studies, I have gained valuable experience in EEG signal acquisition and preprocessing, machine learning, and and decoding algorithms.

## üíª Experience

- ChineseEEG-2:An EEG Dataset for Multimodal Semantic Alignment and Neural Decoding during Reading and Listening, 2024-07 to 2025-01. In this project, I spearheaded the creation of a **multimodal EEG dataset** (128-channel recordings) for Chinese-language neural decoding, implemented **EEG-BIDS standardization** and authored sections of the technical validation protocol, and aligned EEG signals with linguistic stimuli during reading/listening tasks.
- Multimodal Speech Neural Decoding Project, 2025-02-present. Developed encoder-decoder model to map EEG embeddings to speech representations, improving baseline reconstruction accuracy.
