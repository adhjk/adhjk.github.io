### **Lead Experiment Conductor, ChineseEEG-2 Dataset**  
**Southern University of Science and Technology | June 2024 – Jan. 2025**  

- Spearheaded the creation of a multimodal EEG dataset (128-channel recordings) for Chinese-language neural decoding, aligning EEG signals with linguistic stimuli during reading/listening tasks.

- Implemented EEG-BIDS standardization and authored sections of the technical validation protocol.

- Dataset published in Scientific Data (2025), supporting 30+ hours of open-access neural data.



### **Multimodal Speech Neural Decoding Project**  
**Southern University of Science and Technology | Sep 2024 – Present**  

- Developed encoder-decoder model to map EEG embeddings to speech representations, improving baseline reconstruction accuracy.
  
- Addressed teacher-forcing bias and presented findings at 2024 BME Research Day (Outstanding Poster Award).
